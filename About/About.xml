  <description>The expendable transport pod is a ubiquitous technology, used and discarded in the billions by warring outlanders across the Rim to travel long distances in rapid and coordinated fashion. It is efficient, accurate, and low-cost: perfect for delivering weapons and warheads from the safety of one's base.\n\nNote - this mod is purely XML-based, and so these are essentially slightly modified transport pods; use them accordingly.</description>
